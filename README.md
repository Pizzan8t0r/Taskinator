# Taskinator
A simple task web application where you can save, edit and delete the tasks. Simply enter a task name, pick the task's "type", then click add task to add it on the list.
You can edit, delete, and change the progress of each task with a little drop down menu that gets added to each task in the list.
The task then changes it's location depending on the status that is chosen through the dropdown menu, you're be able to create tasks by entering a task name, selecting a type, and clicking an "Add Task" button. Then you'll be able to organize them into Tasks To Do, Tasks In Progress, and Tasks Completed lists by using the dropdown to change the task status.

## Taskinator will allow you to organize your personal to-do list items by using a dropdown menu to change the task status and move the task into To Do, In Progress, and Completed lists. All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web services. 'API' is the broader category because, by definition, it refers to any software component that acts as an intermediary between two otherwise disconnected applications. Web API is used in either a web server or a web browser. Basically Web API is a web development concept. It is limited to Web Applicationâ€™s client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser details. If an application is to be used on a distributed system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then web API services are used. Web API is the enhanced form of the web application.
