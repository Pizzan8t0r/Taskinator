# Taskinator
A simple task web application where you can save, edit and delete the tasks. Simply enter a task name, pick the task's "type", then click add task to add it on the list.
You can edit, delete, and change the progress of each task with a little drop down menu that gets added to each task in the list.
The task then changes it's location depending on the status that is chosen through the dropdown menu.
